# DCGAN-MNIST
This repository serves the purpose of implementing DCGAN in PyTorch as an exercise.

We use MNIST dataset in our experiment, the models should work as expected by feeding other more complex image dataset, but possibly with longer training time.

The code should work fine for RGB images, by setting the variable CHANNELS = 3.
